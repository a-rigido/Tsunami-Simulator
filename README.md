# Tsunami Simulator
## Physics Background:
The motion of fluid flow is described by the well-established Navier-Stokes equations. The shallow water equations are a simplifcation of the Navier-Stokes equations allowing for the motion of shallow layers of liquids under gravitational influence to be described. It should ne noted that the term "shallow" implies that the depth of the fluid is significantly smaller than its horizontal length. Some common applications of the shallow water equations include modelling tides and simulating tsunamis. This script will utilize the 1D shallow water equations and the Two-Step Lax-Wendroff scheme to simulate a 1D tsunami.

## Highlights of Code:
* Utilizes Two-Step Lax-Wendroff
* Visualization of Tsunami using 1D Shallow Water Equation for:
    * Topologically Flat Base (Unchanging Depth)
    * Topologically Varying Base (Tsunami Simulation)
